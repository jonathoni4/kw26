# kw26

In this programming assignment, I implemented a Fibonacci function that avoids repetitive computation by computing the sequence linearly from the bottom up: F(0)throughF(n).The calculation of theF(n)will provide akeyto encrypt a simple text message. You will alsoovercome the limitations of C's 32-bit integers by storing very large integers in arrays of indi-vidual digits.

This code is limited to 40 hexadecimal digit numbers, from the outset,thru the whole program. This will mimic the performance constraints of some old cryptographicequipment (KW-26) that generated key strings based on a 2 number input to start a continuouschain ofsome type ofcalculations to generate long apparently random number sequences. This 40 digit number will be used as an encryption key for a text message, read from a user specified file.
